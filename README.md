# Decred Independent Contractor Roadmap

[WRITE ABOUT, 1. Why this roadmap, 2.Explain this is not a full list, 3. People are not bound to what they say here, 4. How community can provide feedback]



### bee:

Continue producing Decred Journal. I hope to delegate more work to free up time for other [ideas](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues).﻿


### degeri:

I started contributing to Decred 2018 and the response from the community has been very positive. My primary goal is strengthening Decred's security. I do this by selecting 2-3 active projects per month and working on them, I will continue this cycle in 2019.

There is joint research and development ["Decred git/contributor analysis"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/34) work that is being done by both me and @s_ben.

The [Bug bounty proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d33a2667469b56942adf42453def6cc2292325251e4cf791e806939ea9efc9e1) that I put up has passed, I expect this will take up the bulk of my time Q1 of 2019 as we work out any hitches in the rules, scope, methodology etc. After that I will start working on a bug bounty website (for submission, triage, work allocation etc) based on Politeia. I will NOT be billing for this work. The plan to get it built up to a POC stage first before I ask the community for funding and extra hands via a Proposal.

I will also continue helping out the community wherever possible both offline and online. :slightly_smiling_face: 

### Dustorf:

As Marketing Lead, my goal for 2019 at Decred is to generate a consensus on the positioning and messaging, then implement tactics that cultivate the community and project its message. I recently released a blog detailing the hiring of Ditto (https://medium.com/decred/pr-in-politeia-process-progress-and-pitching-in-d88771183dd4), a public relations firm, and we've begun work on messaging. Once this is set, we'll build out the website to reflect the new messaging and add content that offers a deeper dive into Decred without the need to review the docs. I'll present a proposal in the near future that details my plan including budget for the ongoing communications that will include video production and event presence/participation that will build upon Decred's strengths and extend it to new geographies. First the building blocks, then the funnel, then the message projection to drive new users into the funnel.


### elian:

My main contribution to Decred in the past 6 months has been organizing meetups for the crypto community in Mexico, connecting with exchanges in Latam and translating basic content for the Spanish speaking audience.

2019 will be a great year to continue expanding Decred outreach in Mexico and Latam. There are already plans for the next 3 meetups in Mexico City for January, February, and March. In April we will have an expo booth in Talent Land 2019, the biggest tech expo in Mexico and Latam where we are expecting to show the project to more than 33k attendees. I have started conversations with 5 exchanges in Latam in order to have DCR listed this year against MXN, ARS, CLP, and COP. I will continue managing the twitter account @Decred_MX (https://twitter.com/decred_mx) and the Medium Decred en Español (https://medium.com/@decred_es), for fundamental readings and information of Decred in Spanish. Following the steps of Decred BR, I am looking forward to expanding DCR presence in all the Spanish speaking countries and grow our community base in Latam.

### Guang: 

I look forward to contribute to expanding DCR presence in Asia with focus around Southeast Asia and China. I see my role in 2019 be mainly around below 

Contents : Making Decred related contents more accessible to the community, include but not limiting to translating, writing, collaborating with Decred supporters, manage social media. 

Events : Meetups/events in the region, attending events/meetups, identifying (potential) Decred supporters, collaboration on events / meetups 

### Insaf:

In the order to make the Decred project more known in the Arabic world and grow the community my plans are:

 * To contribute more in the social media by writing and translating the main articles about Decred so it can reach a large number of the Arabic crypto members.
 
 * To contact more startups intetested in crypto and Blockchain
 
 * Continue supporting newcomers so they can understand well Decred
 
 * Create a site web that contain all the informations about Decred in Arabic
 
 * To do and participate in more meetups/events locally and in other Arabic countries to expand the decred project in the North Africa and the Middle East.
 
 * To continue managing the twitter account (https://twitter.com/DecredArabia) and the facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/Decred-Arabia-1836611206375151/)

### Michae2xl:

Continue producing Weekly Video for Brazilian Community (Youtube Channel) and Continue help Emilio in brazilians channels. 
Continue supporting newcomers (BR,CA) and slacks invites.
More Meetups in 2019 in Canada-Toronto and if as possible support in Brazil as well.
Building an organic community in Canada, partners, markets and continue helping out the every Decred community (offline, online and in person as well).
(test) I'm thinking in separate features as media's (e.g twitter/decredexplorer) or something like that to find differents ways for people learn about Decred, like a thought structure, so everyone can choose each feature to see first (study the feature like a project and unified later (e.g atomic swap, politeia, spv, dcrdata, decrediton, etc), for the first impact using the docs.decred.org.
Continue manage all media's below and anothers channels as possible to help, improves contents, to use key words (suggetions that I saw in channels), bring more connections like volunteers, devs, holders, so they can help us to growth our community and network (natural process).

### richardred:

My own Decred-related plans for 2019 involve more of the same kind of thing I’ve been doing in 2018, following along and looking for useful ways I can contribute. It’s a dynamic project and I wouldn’t want to guess what that will involve past February or March. I’m not alone in thinking that growing the contributor-base with talented people is one of the main priorities though.

The research program is developing nicely, there are plenty of good ideas and they’re slowly developing — nobody is in a rush.

I will keep doing Politeia Digest for as long as it seems useful, but unless and until the pace of proposals picks up again I will publish it on a more ad hoc timeframe. In other words whenever something interesting happens. There were times when I felt pressure to finish and publish an issue in a certain timeframe (all self-inflicted) while busy with other things, and that made it less enjoyable to work on. It gave me some insight into why the developers on the team prefer not to work towards target dates — total buzz-kill.

The project I am most interested in developing is an information resource/repository about blockchain consensus and governance, making it easier for people to identify, understand, and follow the phenomenon. I have some ideas for how to organize this and what it should look like, but it’s on the back-burner for now and needs some focused attention to figure out what’s likely to work.

### s_ben

My general plan is to continue focusing on technical documentation, while exploring opportunities to contribute code and analysis. 

On the docs front, I plan to continue interfacing with developers and porting relevant technical knowledge to dcrdocs. At some point, if there's enough demand (and content), I plan to finish work begun by other contributors on a separate Decred Developer Documentation site. 

On the coding front, I'm currently collaborating with @degeri on the ["Decred git/contributor analysis"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/34) project, a Decred Open Source Research initiative. I'm finding all the research ideas pitched so far generally fascinating, and will be looking for further opportunities to collaborate there. I'm also learning golang. My plan is to start with small tasks on Politeia and other go repos, learning by doing. If that goes well, will explore the possibility of contributing more substantially and billing for it. 

As I'm relatively new, I also expect to find other opportunities as the year progresses. I'm particularly interested in how the DAE evolves, Politeia, internal systems for processing information, recruiting, and DCR markets. 

### Zubairzia0:

My plans for 2019 are:
outreach - Help to increase presence on Linkedin (and possibly delegate) and grow the Decred community in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) with Michae2xl. 
Research - More research articles https://github.com/zubairzia0/Decred-research
         - Develop a website that displays Security spend alongside other analytics
Development Repos - I have been helping make the user facing Docs more accurate and visual. Will continue to do more of this in 2019. I                     also plan to help out in other repos in 2019.
Organization - I want to put together my own team of contractors to help on the above.
